# Pomodoro Time

This is a simple Pomodoro timer application built using Python and Tkinter. The Pomodoro technique is a time management method that uses a timer to break work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks.

## Features

- Start and reset the timer.
- Work intervals of 25 minutes.
- Short breaks of 5 minutes.
- Long breaks of 20 minutes after every four work sessions.
- Visual indication of work and break intervals.
- Check marks to indicate completed work sessions.

## Installation

1. Ensure you have Python installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
2. Install Tkinter if it's not already installed. Tkinter usually comes pre-installed with Python, but if it's not, you can install it using the following command:

```bash
pip install tk
